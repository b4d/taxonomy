    The MMRTG cost an estimated US$109,000,000 to produce and deploy, and US$83,000,000 to research and develop.[13]
    For comparison the production and deployment of the GPHS-RTG was approximately US$118,000,000.
  question: What is the cost to produce and deploy MMRTG?
- answer: |
    A MMRTG was successfully launched into space on July 30, 2020, aboard the Mars 2020 mission
  question: When was MMRTG successfully launched into space?
- answer: |
    The MMRTG will be used to charge a set of lithium ion batteries, and then use this higher-power-density supply to 
    fly a quad helicopter in short hops above the surface of Titan.
  question: What will power the MMRTG?
- answer: |
    The MMRTG is powered by eight Pu-238 dioxide general-purpose heat source (GPHS) modules, provided by the US Department of Energy (DOE). 
    Initially, these eight GPHS modules generate about 2 kW thermal power.
  question: What is powering MMRTG?
- answer: |
    The multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG) is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) 
    developed for NASA space missions[1] such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), under the jurisdiction of the 
    United States Department of Energy's Office of Space and Defense Power Systems within the Office of Nuclear Energy.
